  faq_3: "We appreciate the enthusiasm but we're not currently hiring any developers.",
  faq_4: "Normally it won't take very long, mostly won't take longer than 15 minutes after we've discovered the bug, worst case scenario we might have to end up removing the command or adding it to experimental commands.",
  faq_5: "We've developed a special command for you in this scenario! If you find a bug report it to as and make us aware of it's existence by running B!reportbug <bug>, we appreciate your contribution in making Bittyconomy as stable as it can be!",
  faq_6: "Yes! We'd love for you to help, we've developed a special command for this! To help us out with command ideas run B!suggest <suggestion>, we appreciate your contribution in expanding Bittyconomy!",
  faq_7: "Unlike some people might think at first glance, Bittyconomy does not require you to run a special command to start using the economy commands, there is no need to create a profile, you can instantly start by running any economy command. TOBC wishes you happy working!",
  faq_8: "Bittyconomy as you might already know is a bot mainly focused on economy, economy bots seem quite similar in commands and concepts, of course some Bittyconomy commands take inspiration from already existing ideas, this does not mean they're duplicates, TOBC tries to change the commands so they don't ruin the fun.",
